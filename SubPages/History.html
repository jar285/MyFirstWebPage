       <p>Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.
           In ancient times, the ancient Sheikah race had developed Hyrule into an advanced civilization, protected by
           four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians.
           When an ancient evil known as Calamity Ganon appeared and threatened Hyrule, four great warriors were given the
           title of Champion, and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon.
           At the same time, the princess, with the blood of the goddess and her appointed knight, fought and defeated him
           by sealing him away.

           <br>
           <br>

           Ten millennia later, the kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state.
           Reading their ancestors' prophecies, the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated surrounding
           areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians.
           During this time, Princess Zelda trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while
           trying to maintain her research. In the meantime, a knight was appointed to protect her:
           Link was chosen due to his ability to wield Master Sword, also known as "the sword that seals the darkness."
           After being sought out by Zelda, the Champions—Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali,
           archer of the birdlike Rito; Daruk, warrior of the mountainous Gorons; and Urbosa, chief of the desert-dwelling
           Gerudo—assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, Vah Rudania, and Vah Naboris, respectively).
           At the same time, Zelda and Link would face Ganon directly.</p>
