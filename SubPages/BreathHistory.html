        <p>Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.
            In ancient times, the ancient Sheikah race had developed Hyrule into an advanced civilization, protected by
            four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians.
            When an ancient evil known as Calamity Ganon appeared and threatened Hyrule, four great warriors were given the
            title of Champion, and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon.
            At the same time, the princess, with the blood of the goddess and her appointed knight, fought and defeated him
            by sealing him away.

            <br>
            <br>

            Ten millennia later, the kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state.
            Reading their ancestors' prophecies, the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated surrounding
            areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians.
            During this time, Princess Zelda trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while
            trying to maintain her research. In the meantime, a knight was appointed to protect her:
            Link was chosen due to his ability to wield Master Sword, also known as "the sword that seals the darkness."
            After being sought out by Zelda, the Champions—Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali,
            archer of the birdlike Rito; Daruk, warrior of the mountainous Gorons; and Urbosa, chief of the desert-dwelling
            Gerudo—assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, Vah Rudania, and Vah Naboris, respectively).
            At the same time, Zelda and Link would face Ganon directly.

            <br>
            <br>

            However, on Zelda's seventeenth birthday, Ganon possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against Hyrule.
            King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, the castle town was destroyed, and Link was gravely wounded protecting Zelda while on their way to Fort Hateno.
            Zelda had Link taken to safety for him to heal, hid the Master Sword in Korok Forest under the protection of the Great Deku Tree, and used her light magic to seal herself and Ganon in Hyrule Castle.
            This cataclysmic tragedy came to be known over time as the Great Calamity.

            <br>
            <br>

            A century after being placed in a healing chamber in the Shrine of Resurrection, an amnesiac Link awakens in a now-ravaged Hyrule.
            He meets an old man, who eventually reveals himself as the lingering spirit of King Rhoam.
            Rhoam explains that Ganon, sealed in Hyrule Castle, has grown stronger; he pleads for Link to defeat Ganon
            before he regains his full strength, breaks free, and destroys the world.

            <br>
            <br>

            Link travels across Hyrule, returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories.
            With the help of Hyrule's people, he boards the four Divine Beasts and purges them of the Ganon Blights
            (Waterblight Ganon, Windblight Ganon, Fireblight Ganon, and Thunderblight Ganon), releasing the spirits of
            Hyrule's former champions and allowing them to pilot the Divine Beasts once again. After obtaining the
            Master Sword from Korok Forest, Link enters Hyrule Castle and confronts Ganon. The Divine Beasts weaken him,
            and after Link defeats him, he transforms into Dark Beast Ganon in an attempt to destroy the world.
            Zelda gives Link the Bow of Light, which allows him to weaken Ganon enough for Zelda to seal him away,
            restoring peace and allowing the spirits of King Rhoam and the Champions to depart to the afterlife.

            <br>
            <br>

            Sensing their presence, Link and Zelda smile fondly.
            If players have found all thirteen memories in the "Captured Memories" main quest, they unlock a post-credits
            cutscene in which Zelda declares that Hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and Link must begin the process by themselves.
            As Link and Zelda survey Hyrule and embark to restore it to—and perhaps beyond—its former glory,
            the princess confides in him that she may no longer possess any supernatural power, yet has come to terms with it.
