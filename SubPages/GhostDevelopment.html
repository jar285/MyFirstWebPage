    <h3>Ghost Of Tsushima's Combat Took Six Years To Perfect</h3>
    <img src="../Images/Ghost_Of_Tsushima_Image_1.jpeg" alt="Ghost Main" class="center3" height="533">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>One of the standout gameplay elements from Ghost of Tsushima is the game's in-depth combat system, which makes
        sense considering developer Sucker Punch Productions spent six years perfecting it. The game was the last major
        PlayStation 4 exclusive to be released before the launch of Sony's PlayStation 5.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ghost of Tsushima ended up being a massive success both financially and critically. The game set sales records
        for the PS4 just months before the console got replaced by the PS5, and it was even a nominee for the 2020 game
        of the year. After the release of the PS5, the title has made a smooth transition to the new hardware, even
        though it has yet to get a native version for the platform, and has become one of the most completed games
        on Sony's console line. All of this success was over half a decade in the making and can be attributed to the
        development team at Sucker Punch.</p>
    <br>
    <p>IGN reported on a recent ask me anything session at GDC Showcase, where Sucker Punch's co-founder, Brian Fleming,
        was asked what feature of Ghost of Tsushima was the most difficult to implement. Fleming answered that it was
        quickly the combat because it took nonstop work for six years to get it right. According to the co-founder, the
        development team built multiple versions of the system to figure out what worked in every possible scenario
        since combat was a central aspect of the game. While Fleming is pleased with the results, he does admit that the
        whole process was complex.</p>
